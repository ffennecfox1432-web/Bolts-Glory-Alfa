Ajolote!

Of the planned features, only some were able to actually be finished. It was planned to be able to use the NPCs as both workers and soldiers, but right now they work pretty much like guards

Wooden_Automata_Kit - Crafteable "egg" that serves to spawn an Automata
SkeletonSpawner - Originally wanted to make an item that killed a skeleton and spawned a Friendly_Skeleton in their place, instead just made an Spawner.
Banner - Intended to be used to command armies, has no functiona use, just looks pretty.

There may or may not be a bunch of unused animations intended for directional blocking and attacking, never implemented.
